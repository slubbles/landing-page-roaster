## Twitter/X — Launch Thread

### Tweet 1 (Hook)

I built an AI that roasts your landing page in 30 seconds.

It screenshots your page, analyzes the hero, CTAs, copy, social proof, mobile UX, speed, trust signals, and design — then gives you a score out of 100 with specific fixes.

It's free. Here's the link: [LINK]

🧵 ↓

### Tweet 2 (Social proof)

I roasted some famous landing pages to test it:

• stripe.com → 72/100 — "Too many paths, not enough clarity"
• linear.app → 42/100 — "Beautiful design hiding a conversion-killing mess"
• calendly.com → 78/100 — "Strong CTA, weak social proof"
• dropbox.com → 51/100 — "A legacy brand coasting on name recognition"

Your turn.

### Tweet 3 (How it works)

How it works:

1. Paste any URL
2. AI scrapes desktop + mobile screenshots, DOM structure, performance metrics
3. Claude analyzes 9 conversion categories
4. You get a brutally honest report with exact fixes

Takes ~30 seconds.

### Tweet 4 (CTA)

Built this as part of a $100 challenge — $50 infra, $50 API credits.

If this helps you fix even one conversion-killing mistake, drop me a follow.

## Twitter/X — Standalone Tweets (Post these individually over a week)

### Standalone 1
Your landing page has a 72% chance of scoring below 60/100.

How do I know? I roasted 50+ pages with AI and most founders have the same 3 mistakes:

1. Hero that talks about features instead of outcomes
2. CTA that says "Get Started" (get started with WHAT?)
3. Zero social proof above the fold

Free roast → [LINK]

### Standalone 2
The fastest way to increase your conversion rate by 20%:

Fix your hero headline.
Move social proof above the fold.
Change "Get Started" to something specific.

Or just paste your URL here and let AI find all the issues: [LINK]

### Standalone 3
I roasted Vercel's landing page with AI.

Score: 58/100

Main issues:
• "Frontend Cloud" — assumes you know what that means
• "Start Deploying" — deploy what?
• Impressive tech demos but zero business outcome messaging

Your page might have the same problems → [LINK]

### Standalone 4
Hot take: Most SaaS landing pages are designed for designers, not for conversions.

Pretty gradients ≠ clear value proposition
Minimal copy ≠ persuasive copy
"Book a demo" ≠ low-friction CTA

AI will roast the truth out of your page: [LINK]

## Reddit — r/startups (Title + Body)

**Title:** I built a free AI tool that roasts your landing page and tells you exactly why it's not converting

**Body:**

Hey r/startups,

I built PageRoast — paste any landing page URL and get a brutally honest AI teardown in 30 seconds.

**What it does:**
- Screenshots your page (desktop + mobile)
- Analyzes 9 conversion categories: hero section, CTAs, copywriting, social proof, mobile UX, page speed, trust signals, design, and overall conversion score
- Gives you specific issues found + exact fixes to implement
- Scores you 0-100

**Why I built it:**
I kept seeing the same conversion mistakes on landing pages — vague headlines, generic CTAs ("Get Started"), no social proof above the fold, broken mobile experiences. Instead of reviewing them manually, I automated the whole audit.

**How it works (technically):**
Puppeteer scrapes the page → captures screenshots → extracts DOM data, performance metrics, mobile responsiveness → sends everything to Claude for analysis → structured JSON report with scores, roasts, and fixes.

**Some real scores:**
- stripe.com: 72/100
- linear.app: 42/100
- calendly.com: 78/100
- dropbox.com: 51/100

It's free to use. No login required.

Would love feedback from this community. What categories should I add?

## Reddit — r/Entrepreneur

**Title:** Every landing page I've audited has these 3 conversion killers (free AI tool inside)

**Body:**

After roasting 50+ landing pages with an AI auditing tool I built, here are the 3 most common conversion killers:

**1. The Feature Dump Hero**
Your headline talks about what your product *does* instead of what it *does for the customer*. "AI-powered project management" vs "Ship projects 2x faster without the chaos."

**2. The Generic CTA**
"Get Started" / "Learn More" / "Sign Up" — these tell the user nothing about what happens next. "Start your free audit" / "See your score" / "Get your report" — these convert.

**3. Social Proof Below the Fold**
If I have to scroll to see that other humans trust you, you've already lost 40% of visitors. Testimonials, logos, numbers — put them where they matter.

I built a free tool that catches these (and 6 other categories) automatically. Paste your URL, get a score and specific fixes in 30 seconds.

## Reddit — r/webdesign

**Title:** Built a free AI tool that analyzes landing page design and gives conversion-focused feedback

**Body:**

As designers we optimize for aesthetics, but sometimes that hurts conversion. I built a tool that bridges the gap — it scores landing pages on both design quality AND conversion effectiveness.

It analyzes:
- Visual hierarchy and whitespace
- Color psychology and contrast
- CTA button design, placement, and copy
- Mobile responsiveness
- Typography and readability
- Hero section effectiveness

Each category gets a detailed roast + specific fixes.

Some surprising results: linear.app scores 8/10 on design but only 3/10 on CTAs. Pretty ≠ converting.

**Title:** PageRoast: AI-Powered Landing Page Auditor (Free, No Signup)

**Body:**

### 👋 Hey IH!

I'm launching **PageRoast** — an AI tool that roasts your landing page in 30 seconds.

### The Problem
Most founders (myself included) build landing pages based on vibes. "Looks good to me" isn't a conversion strategy.

### The Solution
Paste any URL → AI scrapes it, analyzes 9 conversion categories, and gives you:
- A score out of 100
- Category-by-category breakdown (hero, CTAs, copy, social proof, mobile, speed, trust, design)
- Specific issues found with exact fixes
- Top priorities and quick wins
- Estimated conversion lift

### How It's Built
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- **Scraping:** Puppeteer (serverless with @sparticuz/chromium)
- **AI:** Claude (Anthropic)
- **Storage:** Vercel Blob
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Payments:** Polar.sh (for the Pro tier)

### The Numbers
- Built in ~4 sessions as part of a $100 challenge
- Total spend: ~$3 in API credits
- Revenue: $0 (just launched!)

### Business Model
- **Free:** Overall score + top 3 fixes + screenshots
- **Pro ($29):** Full 9-category breakdown, competitor comparison, A/B test suggestions, copywriting rewrites

### Some Famous Page Scores
- stripe.com: 72/100
- linear.app: 42/100
